# Maze Solver

MazeSolver is an interactive web application that generates and solves mazes using various algorithms. It provides a visual representation of maze generation and solving processes.

Built as an experiment using AI agents to generate the code.

## Features

- Generate mazes using three different algorithms:
  - Prim's Algorithm
  - Recursive Backtracking
  - Kruskal's Algorithm

- Customize maze dimensions (width and height)
- Solve generated mazes with visual path finding
- Adjust solving speed with customizable delay
- Interactive canvas display with color-coded cells
